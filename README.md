# SE-Documentation-Learning
Learning the basics of Software Engineering, at Parthenope University of Naples. Study-Project.


This repository contains PDF files and a short presentation of EasyWander interface. PDF files are made in Latex and interface's prototype is made with Marvel-Prototype but I've developed later the interface in a different repository because it belongs to another exams based on the web technologies and languages, name of repo is "EasyWander-1" and the forked "EasyWander-2".
